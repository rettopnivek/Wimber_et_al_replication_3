# Wimber_et_al_replication_3
Matlab, Psychtoolbox, and R code for 3 experimental replications of Wimber et al. (2015)

Note that for the 3rd replication, during the selective retrieval stage some image numbers were not correctly recorded. This issue was fixed post-hoc and the corrected files can be found in the 'Replication 3/Analyses/Data/Wimber_Dat_corrected' folder.

Note that for the 2nd replication, data from additional subjects were collected, but this data is located in the 'Replication 3/Analyses/Data/Additional_subjects_exp_2' folder.
