'Building mental images of faces, places & objects\n' ...
'\n' ...
'In this experiment, we are trying to replicate the \n' ...
'behavioral results of a recent and innovative brain \n' ...
'imaging study. You will be completing several different \n' ...
'memory tasks involving pictures and words. There \n' ...
'will be 5 different phases. '

'The experiment should take 1 hour and 45 minutes. You will earn \n' ...
'a total of 20 dollars by the end. The manner in which you give \n' ...
'answers will change for different memory tests, so please read the \n' ...
'detailed instructions shown on the screen before each test. \n' ...
'Memorizing can be dull and difficult, but please try your best. \n' ...
'We appreciate your effort!'

'Familiarization\n' ...
'\n' ...
'The first part will take approximately 15 minutes. In this \n' ...
'part, we will familiarize you with the different kinds of \n' ...
'pictures that will later be used for the imagery part, and \n' ...
'make sure that you can recognize each picture more easily. \n' ...
'Specifically, you will be shown pictures of well-known \n' ...
'faces, places, and objects. Over the course of this \n' ...
'familiarization phase, you will see two different versions \n' ...
'of each picture. '

'Each picture will first appear alone on the screen, followed \n' ...
'by a label describing the content of the picture. Your task \n' ...
'is to look at each picture carefully, and indicate with a \n' ...
'button press whether you could have recognized the \n' ...
'corresponding person, place, or object without the label. \n' ...
'Please press the "j" key with your index finger to indicate \n' ...
'that you would have recognized the picture without the label, \n' ...
'and the "k" key with your middle finger to indicate that you \n' ...
'would not have recognized the picture without the label. \n'

'You will likely recognize many of the images, but some might \n' ...
'be unknown to you, or it might not be immediately clear what \n' ...
'is being depicted. If you indicate that you cannot identify \n' ...
'a particular picture, it will be shown for a second time \n' ...
'towards the end of the familiarization phase.'

'The main part of the experiment (approximately 1 hour) is \n' ...
'dedicated to train you up for the final pair of tasks. These \n' ...
'tasks are typically used in brain imaging studies, in which \n' ...
'participants visualize pictures, with the goal being to \n' ...
'predict, merely based on their brain activity, which picture \n' ...
'they have in mind. '

'In the next ~60 min, we will therefore train you on \n' ...
'associations between words and pictures, such that after \n' ...
'the training, when you are presented with a specific word, \n' ...
'you will be able to produce a vivid mental image of the \n' ...
'corresponding picture. This phase is separated into several \n' ...
'blocks, with each block training you on approximately 24 \n' ...
'word-picture associations. Initially, you will see one word \n' ...
'and one picture at a time, presented together for 4 sec each.'

'Your task is to form a visual association between the two so  \n' ...
'that when given the word, you can visualize the picture.  \n' ...
'Because later you will be asked to fully visualize the  \n' ...
'specific picture that goes together with the word, the  \n' ...
'strategy I am asking you to use is to take the picture on  \n' ...
'the screen, and use the meaning of the word to mentally  \n' ...
'transform the picture (e.g., make it move, or add something  \n' ...
'to it). For example, you might see the word “jump” and the  \n' ...
'face of the Dalai Lama, so you could imagine the Dalai Lama’s  \n' ...
'ears or his glasses jumping in the picture. '

'After this initial training, you will be shown words alone, \n' ...
'and your task is to visualize the corresponding picture and \n' ...
'name it aloud as quickly as possible so we can verify that \n' ...
'you have the correct image in mind. A few seconds later, two \n' ...
'different versions of the correct picture will appear on \n' ...
'the screen, and your task is to indicate, via button press, \n' ...
'which of the two versions was paired with the word ("j" \n' ...
'key = left, "k" key = right). '

'A green frame will then give you feedback about the correct \n' ...
'choice. Use this feedback to memorize some specific detail \n' ...
'that distinguishes the two pictures, because you will later \n' ...
'be asked to visualize this specific picture, and I will \n' ...
'also ask you, at the very end of the experiment, which one \n' ...
'of the two similar pictures had been paired with a word. \n' ...
'After each word-picture pair has been tested twice, you \n' ...
'will be trained on a new set of word-picture pairs.\n' ...

'Training of word-picture associations II\n' ...
' \n' ...
'The next part will take about 20 minutes, and is very similar \n' ...
'to the one you have just finished. The task will, however, \n' ...
'become slightly more challenging for two reasons. First, \n' ...
'you will use words that you have already linked to a \n' ...
'different picture before, and will link these to a new \n' ...
'picture (one that hasn’t been linked to any word yet). '

'Even though you have previously linked the same words to a \n' ...
'different picture, it is very important that you come up \n' ...
'with a new, fresh mental image for each word-picture \n' ...
'pairing. Please do not form any links between the new \n' ...
'picture and the one that had been paired with the same word \n' ...
'before! The new image should be treated separately from the \n' ...
'first, and be a fresh new effort on your part. '

'After each series of 24 pairs, you will be assessed \n' ...
'on your ability to visualize each picture in response to \n' ...
'the hint word, and you will get feedback on the correct \n' ...
'answer. Again, please use this feedback to find a detail \n' ...
'that helps you to distinguish which of the two pictures was \n' ...
'linked with the word, because you will need that information \n' ...
'in the future tasks. Second, the task will also be slightly \n' ...
'more challenging because there will only be one round \n' ...
'(instead of two rounds) of feedback for each set of \n' ...
'word-picture pairs. '

'This is the first of the last two tasks. The ultimate goal \n' ...
'of this study is to see if we can get similar results to \n' ...
'studies trying to predict, based on brain activity, which \n' ...
'category the image a person has in mind comes from i.e., \n' ...
'whether you are currently thinking of a face, a place or an \n' ...
'object. '

'On each trial, you will see one word alone on the screen, \n' ...
'and your task is to visualize the very first picture that \n' ...
'you initially learned to visualize in response to this word, \n' ...
'that is, in the very first of the training sessions. \n' ...
'When focusing on the original picture, it is very important \n' ...
'that you will not simply think of the correct label of the \n' ...
'picture, but that you really try to visualize the correct \n' ...
'picture as vividly as possible, exploring all the details \n' ...
'of the face, the place, or the object in your mind for the \n' ...
'full 4 seconds that the reminder word is on the screen. '

'After 4 seconds, you will be asked to press a key indicating \n' ...
'which category the picture you have in mind comes from. \n' ...
'Please press "j" (index finger) if you are thinking of a \n' ...
'face, "k" (middle finger) if you are thinking of an object, \n' ...
'and "l" (ring finger) if you are thinking of a scene. If \n' ...
'you are unable to come up with the correct image, please \n' ...
'indicate by pressing ";" (pinkie). '

'Even if you see a word for the third of fourth time, it is \n' ...
'very important that you vividly bring the corresponding \n' ...
'picture back to mind in all its detail. Likewise, even if \n' ...
'you cannot bring up the correct image the first time, keep \n' ...
'trying when you see the word for the second, third or \n' ...
'fourth time. '

'Picture discrimination\n' ...
' \n' ...
'In this last part of the experiment, which will take \n' ...
'approximately 10 minutes, you will simultaneously see two \n' ...
'versions of each of the pictures you have initially seen \n' ...
'together on the screen. Your task is to indicate which of \n' ...
'the two versions you had previously associated with a word. \n' ...
'Importantly, you have seen all of these pictures at the \n' ...
'very beginning of the experiment, so both versions will \n' ...
'look familiar to you. It is therefore critical that you \n' ...
'think back to the training phases, and chose the picture \n' ...
'that you have linked with a word before. '

'This task is about speed! Select the correct picture ("j" \n' ...
'key = left, "k" key = right) as fast as possible, and guess \n' ...
'if you cannot remember. '
